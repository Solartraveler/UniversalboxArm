Bugs in Version 1.0:

1. == While programming the AVR, the right button may not be pressed ==
   Otherwise SCK of the programmer is short to GND
   Workaround: Don't press the right button while programming, disconnect programmer before testing
   Next version: Put a resistor in the SCK line to J20
2. == The output of the temperature sensor is connected to a digital input ==
   Workaround: Remove D24, connect Pin 1 of TH20 (Temperature output) to PB5 (at J20 this is easy)
   Cut PB0 before it goes to TH20 and then make a connection of PB0 (again from J20) to the anode pad of D24.
   Next version: Switch PB5 and PB0.
3 == R31 needs to be a diode ==
   Otherwise the low resistance of U2 will drop the level of Q23 and Q24 to low ending in those fets to be always on
   So the ARM could not be switched off while on battery power.
   A diode in a 0805 case can be soldered on the R31 easily
   Next version: Really add a diode here
4. == Too much ripple while charing ==
   C23 is too small, the maximum capacity available at 0805 is 22ÂµF
   Next version: Use a 1208 footprint there
5. == Description on the PCB is at the wrong place ==
   The "only H7" description is next to C64, but should be next to C71
   Next version: Move description
6. == TL431B is difficult to get in low quantities ==
   Next version: Change footprint to use TS431B instead
7. == Reset of LCD needs a pullup ==
   If JP50 is left open (no control by GPIO), the reset needs a pull up to the PerEnablePower signal.
   Workaround: Add a 10k pull up on the J50 connecter. Or close JP50 and use the GPIO.
   Next version: Allow adding a pullup resiter.
8. == Low and high speed crystals are switched ==
   Workaround: Solder a low speed crystal at the footprint of the highspeed crystal (Y60).
   And a high speed crystal at Y61.
   Next version: Fix footprint and reorder crystals.
9. == ESD Protection for some pins is not complete ==
   The ESD protection is for 5V inputs. But PA3 and PA4 only support an input of 3.3V.
