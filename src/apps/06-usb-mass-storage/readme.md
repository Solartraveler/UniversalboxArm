Implements USB mass-storage

The PC can read and write the external flash as a normal USB pen drive.

There is no GUI.

Left key -> Reset (a block write is completed before).

Down key -> USB disconnect.

Up key -> USB connect.

1. LED green -> no USB traffic, red -> USB traffic.

2. LED green -> processing read commands, red -> processing write commands.

Debug messages go over the RS232 port.
