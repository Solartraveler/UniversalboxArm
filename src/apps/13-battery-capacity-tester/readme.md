Discharges a batterie until the voltage drops below a defined minimum.

Then the discharged capacity is written to a log file.

Select an appropriate load resistor able to handle the heat and limit the current to 2A.

The selected resistor may be in the range of 0.5Ω to 20Ω.

If sink 1 is active, the LED1 lights green. Sink 2 uses the red light of LED1.
