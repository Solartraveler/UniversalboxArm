battU: Battery voltage in [mV]
inU: Input voltage in [mV]
battI: Charging current in [mA]
battTemp: Battery temperature in [0.1Â°C]
inImax: Maximum allowed charging current in [mA]
timePassed: Time in [ms] since the last call. Minimum is 50ms to avoid oscilations.
requestFullCharge: Automatic recharging starts when the battery is already partly empty.
  Setting this to 1 for one cycle, starts a charge even if the voltage is not low enough
  to start the automatic recharge.

To not trigger an error, the charger current must be measured before the input voltage,
because a current of 0 with an input voltage is considered a hardware error.
There could be a power cord removal between the two measurements.

Returns: PWM value
